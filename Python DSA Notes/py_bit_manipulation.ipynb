# XOR (eXclusive OR) in Bit Manipulation

XOR (eXclusive OR) is a binary operation that compares two bits and outputs a result based on the following rules:

- **Same bits:**  
  `0 ^ 0 = 0`, `1 ^ 1 = 0`
- **Different bits:**  
  `0 ^ 1 = 1`, `1 ^ 0 = 1`

## Four Essential XOR Properties

### 1. Same Numbers XOR to Zero

**Property:** `a ^ a = 0`

When you XOR any number with itself, the result is always zero.

**Example:**
```python
5 ^ 5  # 0
3 ^ 3  # 0
7 ^ 7  # 0
42 ^ 42  # 0
```
**Explanation:**  
Identical numbers have the same bits at every position, so XOR returns all zeros.

---

### 2. XOR with Zero Returns the Original Number

**Property:** `a ^ 0 = a`

XORing any number with zero returns the original number unchanged.

**Example:**
```python
5 ^ 0   # 5
8 ^ 0   # 8
15 ^ 0  # 15
100 ^ 0 # 100
```
**Explanation:**  
Zero acts as the "identity element" for XOR operations.

### 3. Commutative Property (Order Doesn't Matter)

**Property:** `a ^ b = b ^ a`

XOR is commutative, meaning the order of operands doesn't affect the result.

**Example:**
```python
5 ^ 3 == 3 ^ 5  # True, both equal 6
2 ^ 7 == 7 ^ 2  # True, both equal 5
4 ^ 9 == 9 ^ 4  # True, both equal 13
1 ^ 6 == 6 ^ 1  # True, both equal 7
```

---

### 4. Associative Property (Grouping Doesn't Matter)

**Property:** `(a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)`

XOR is also associative, meaning how you group the operations doesn't change the result.

**Example:**
```python
(5 ^ 3) ^ 2 == 5 ^ (3 ^ 2)  # Both equal 4

# Chain of operations:
result1 = ((((2 ^ 1) ^ 3) ^ 4) ^ 5)
result2 = (2 ^ (1 ^ (3 ^ (4 ^ 5))))
result3 = 2 ^ ((1 ^ 3) ^ (4 ^ 5))
# All groupings yield the same result
```

## Practical Application: Single Number Problem

Let's apply these properties to solve a real problem.

**Problem:**  
Given a list where every element appears twice except for one, find that single one.

**Example:**
```python
nums = [2, 1, 2, 3, 1]
result = 0
for num in nums:
    result ^= num
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

**Step-by-step:**
```
Start: result = 0
result ^= 2  →  result = 2
result ^= 1  →  result = 3  
result ^= 2  →  result = 1
result ^= 3  →  result = 2
result ^= 1  →  result = 3  ← Final answer!
```

**Why Does XOR Work?**

Mathematical explanation using XOR properties:
```
0 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 1
= 0 ^ (2 ^ 2) ^ (1 ^ 1) ^ 3    # Commutative & Associative
= 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 3                # Same numbers = 0
= 3                            # Number with 0 = itself
```

**Key Points:**
- Numbers appearing twice cancel out (become 0) due to XOR properties.
- The single number remains because `number ^ 0 = number`.
- Commutative and associative properties allow flexible calculation order.

## Summary

The four essential XOR properties:

1. **Same numbers XOR to zero:** `a ^ a = 0`
2. **XOR with zero returns original:** `a ^ 0 = a`
3. **Commutative:** `a ^ b = b ^ a`
4. **Associative:** `(a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)`

Understanding these properties enables the implementation of highly efficient algorithms. XOR is particularly powerful when you need to minimize memory usage or require high-speed bit-level operations.

## Conclusion

XOR is more than just a bitwise operator—it's a gateway to efficient algorithm design. The four properties discussed here form the foundation for understanding advanced bit manipulation techniques.

Whether you're solving coding challenges, optimizing system performance, or implementing cryptographic algorithms, XOR properties will prove invaluable in your programming toolkit.
